# Intents

Ever wanted something like the Facebook LIKE button that defers the LIKE action till the user is authenticated? Or the tweet button that saves the tweet and tweets it only after some condition is met?

If you build a web application with these kind of problems, you'd run into problems like these

That's what Intents helps you do.
